# My Scripts

Hello and welcome to my personal scripts repository. This repository contains all kinds of scripts for various purposes stashed within, primarilly written in bash.

## Disclaimer

While you are free to browse, use, modify, or adapt any of the files here, **please note** that they are tailored for a NixOS Environment, and will likely fail to work on more contemporary distros or MacOS without prior modification.

These scripts have also been designed to solve issues I have encountered, or to automate tasks on my personal machines, and thus, while you are free to use them as you see fit, I make no guarantee that they will work for you or be suitable for your setup.

## Usage

If you wish to explore or utilize any of these scripts, feel free to do so at your own discretion. However, as mentioned above, these scripts are unlikely to work for you out-of-the-box. I highly recommend you first download and peruse the code of the script first.

## Contributions

I appreciate insights or suggestions, but since this repository exists for my personal use, I am unlikely to accept pull requests. If you have any improvements or modifications, feel free to fork this repositoryand adapt it to your needs.
